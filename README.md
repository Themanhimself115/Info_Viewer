# Info_Viewer
shows device info for quick use
WIP
-----------------

Code is new and going to be adding more things.
Will also change the file names....

-----------------

I'm using it to provide quick information for my Raspberry Pi's e-ink display due to changes in Ipv4 while it connects to different networks.
This is quick to check what the wifi name and ip for the device is instead of having to type in the terminal

-----------------

Use it, its open source
